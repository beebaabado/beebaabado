### Hi 👋  I'm Connie
Pronouns: she/her/hers

How I got here...
After a bit of a meandering but rewarding path from software developer, to full time parent which included the challenges of being chairperson/treasurer/board member/fundraising liason to various organizations, a coding mentor, a pro-bono website manager, to finding my way back to my first love coding,  I eagerly await a chance to collaborate on a creative and challenging project.  


🔭 In the meanwhile, I’m currently working on a fun project with a colleague.  We both love beer 🍺 and have come up with a little project to display where the best beer is no matter where we might be located (and wifi is available 😄).  

🌱 I’m also currently focused on beefing up my backend web developer skills through Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nano degree program. ✨I just completed my last project! ✨There is so much I am curious about so I'm also dabbling a bit with machine learning and data science and collaborating on a small game with my son using the Godot game engine.  

In the end, I can't seem to let go of my other inspiration and always looking to collaborate on projects for non-proifts.  I feel compelled to help others and have spent countless hours volunteering from running fundraisers for our local schools, updating websites for various non-profits, and to mentoring students of all ages in STEM projects including coding projects.  

💬 Feel free to contact me.  I would love to volunteer my technical expertise to your non-profit. 📫 You can email me at connie@wright.cool.  Would love to hear from you!  


- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been a Colorado Master Gardener for over 11 years through the Colorado State University Extension Program. I love plants 🌿 🌳 🌸 of all kinds and sizes and sharing my knowlegde with the public.
